# Normalization Process

## First Normal Form (1NF)

- Ensured that each table has atomic values and no repeating groups.

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

- Separated multivalued attributes into different tables.
- All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key.

## Third Normal Form (3NF)

- Removed transitive dependencies.
- Ensured that non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.

The final design achieves 3NF and avoids redundancy.
